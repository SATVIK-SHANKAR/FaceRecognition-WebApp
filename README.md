# Real-Time Face Recognition Web App

## Overview
This project is a real-time face recognition web application built using Flask, OpenCV, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for accurate face recognition. It captures video frames from a webcam, detects faces using the Haar Cascade Classifier, collects face data for registration, and performs face recognition in real-time. Users can register new faces and recognize registered faces directly through the web interface.

## Project Structure
The structure of this web-based project is as follows:

- **static/css/style.css**: Styles for the web UI, including layout and aesthetic improvements.
- **static/js/main.js**: Contains JavaScript functions for registering and recognizing faces with real-time feedback.
- **templates/base.html** and **index.html**: HTML templates for the web interface, using Jinja for rendering dynamic content.
- **app.py**: Flask application to handle routing, video feed, and face recognition functions.
- **camera.py**: Captures video from the webcam and detects faces using the Haar Cascade Classifier.
- **face_utils.py**: Manages face data registration, saving, loading, and recognition using KNN.
- **face_dataset/**: Directory where face data is stored as `.npy` files for registered users.
- **models/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml**: Haar Cascade model file for face detection.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-recognition-webapp.git
   cd real-time-face-recognition-webapp

## Setup and Installation

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure Python is installed, then install the required libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download Haar Cascade Classifier:** Download the `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` file if not already present and place it in the `models` directory.

## Running the Project

1. **Start the Flask App:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Access the Web App:** Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Register a New User:** Enter a name in the input field, click **Register New User**, and allow the app to capture face data for registration.

4. **Recognize Face:** Click **Recognize Face** to identify registered users in real-time.

## Prototype

Below is a screenshot of the Face Recognition System web app prototype.

This interface allows users to register their faces by entering their name and recognizing faces in real-time. The detected faces are highlighted with a green box.

## Key Concepts and Theory

### Haar Cascade Classifier
This method uses positive and negative images to train the model to recognize faces with high accuracy. Itâ€™s particularly effective for face detection and performs efficiently in real-time applications.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is used to classify faces based on the `k` nearest neighbors from the stored face dataset. Its simplicity and interpretability make it suitable for this face recognition application.

## Applications

- **Security Systems**: Real-time face recognition for improved security.
- **User Authentication**: Secure device unlocking or identity verification.
- **Personalized User Experience**: Enhances services with user recognition.

## Advantages

- **Real-Time Processing**: Provides immediate face detection and recognition.
- **High Accuracy**: Reliable face recognition based on trained datasets.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple users in the dataset for recognition.
